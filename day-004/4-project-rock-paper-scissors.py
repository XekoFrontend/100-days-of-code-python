#  This exercise applies the concepts of importing modules, using the random library, list, and conditional statements using if-else blocks.

'''
Step 1: Understand the rules: 2 > 1 > 0
Scissors (2) beats Paper (1).
Paper (1) beats Rock (0).
Rock (0) beats Scissors (2).
If both the user and the computer choose the same, it's a draw.

Step 2: Special Cases:
If the user chooses 0 (Rock) and the computer chooses 2 (Scissors), the user wins.
If both the user and the computer choose the same, itâ€™s a draw.
If the computer chooses 0 (Rock) and the user chooses 2 (Scissors), the user loses.

Step 3: Determine the Winner
If the userâ€™s choice is greater than the computerâ€™s choice, the user wins.
If the userâ€™s choice is less than the computerâ€™s choice, the user loses.

Step 4: Handle Invalid Input
Print a message if the user enters a number outside of the range 0 - 2.
Place this validation in the first if statement.

Sumary:
1.Print a message if the user enters a number outside of 0 - 2. This should be the first check.
2. Compare the userâ€™s choice with the computerâ€™s choice.
3. Add the draw case if the userâ€™s choice is the same as the computerâ€™s choice.
4. Handle the case where the computer is 0 (Rock) and the user is 2 (Scissors) which means the user loses.
5. If the userâ€™s choice is greater than the computerâ€™s choice, the user wins.
