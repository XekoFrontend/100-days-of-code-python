Every year that is divisible by 4 with no remainder
Except every year that is evenly divisible by 100 with no remainder
Unless the year is also divisible by 400 with no remainder

If english is not your first language or if the above logic is confusing, try using this flow chart .

e.g. The year 2000:
2000 ÷ 4 = 500 (Leap)
2000 ÷ 100 = 20 (Not Leap)
2000 ÷ 400 = 5 (Leap!)
So the year 2000 is a leap year.

But the year 2100 is not a leap year because:
2100 ÷ 4 = 525 (Leap)
2100 ÷ 100 = 21 (Not Leap)
2100 ÷ 400 = 5.25 (Not Leap)
